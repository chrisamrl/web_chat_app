## Description
A very simple chat app implemented using Socket.io and Node. Every user that is in the chatroom can interact with each other. 

## How to run
* Fork this project
* On terminal, write "npm run devStart" (To change devStart, simply change the script in package.json)
* Nodemon will be started
* Open your local host! 

### Why I made this:
**(October, 27):** This project is a single component of my planned larger project. I initally 
wanted to create a simple 2-player online web game where users can login by simple username / password
(like https://pokemonshowdown.com, I really like this game). 
But currently I don't have enough time because Mid-term is coming, so I'll probably continue this project in the future.
